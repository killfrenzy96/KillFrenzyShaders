# KillFrenzy Shaders
These shaders were created for use on avatars for VRChat or similar applications. They are not meant to be realistic shaders. They are designed to look more consistent between various different lighting situations found in worlds from VRChat. Some extra shders may be included in this package.

# Credits
Some parts of this shader were derived from Xiexe's Unity Shaders, under the MIT license.
