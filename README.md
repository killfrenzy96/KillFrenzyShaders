# KillFrenzy Shaders
These shaders were created as a learning experience to get me into shader programming.

The avatar shaders are designed for VRChat or similar applications. They are not meant to be realistic shaders. They are designed to look more consistent between various different lighting situations found in worlds from VRChat.

This package also includes some niche shaders I have created as well. They may be useful in some cases.
